# Team xdfty37dr3's Hackathon Submission

First off, thanks for this experience. Team xdfty37dr3 really enjoyed this hackathon, and plans to do many more in the future. Having said that, here is our project - WebKnight: Rowan's Tale!

## Description

WebKnights was inspired by a love for programming and a love for fun. Honestly speaking, most people find learning coding boring, and that's why not everybody codes. The goal of this game is to provide a fun and engaging way for learners to gain more knowledge of programming. This game focuses on Web programming. (Unfortunately, it wasn't finished within the 48 hours.) This project falls under theme 4 - introducing software development to a beginner. WebKnight puts the player in the position of a character living within his/her web browser, and teaches him/her to  use Javascript to interact with the character's world. Players can use the "Scriptor" to execute code commands, and the game is written interactively and waits for the user to complete tasks before continuing. The idea is that by the end of the game, the user will not only know the basics of coding, but also be very interested and want to pursue the field even more afterwards.
